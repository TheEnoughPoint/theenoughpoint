"""link-sweep.py — every link on the built site, checked.

Run from the repo root after a build:

    python scripts/link-sweep.py             # offline checks, fast
    python scripts/link-sweep.py --external  # also probe every external URL

Exit code 0 means clean; 1 means something below needs a human.

WHY THIS EXISTS
Each check earned its place on 22 Aug 2026, the day a reader's WhatsApp
compose box surfaced a share link whose prefilled text began with the literal
word "undefined" — live, on four articles, invisible to the build, the static
checker and the render audit of the day.

WHAT IT CHECKS
1. Defect patterns inside href/src values: serialised undefined/null/NaN,
   localhost, double-encoded %2520, [object. These are always bugs.
   (Case-sensitive on NaN deliberately: the first run of this sweep reported
   307 defects, every one a case-insensitive "NaN" matching inside the word
   "fiNANce". A checker that cries wolf gets ignored.)
2. Internal integrity: every root-relative link resolves to a built page or
   file in dist/.
3. Share-link sanity: every article's WhatsApp link carries a real title
   before its URL.
4. Host consistency: absolute self-references should all use one host form.
   (The site canonicalises on the apex; a stray www link is drift.)
5. --external only: HEAD/GET every unique external URL. Known bot-walls
   (Bloomberg, SSRN, and friends) are reported separately, not failed — a 403
   from them is not proof the link is broken for a reader; verify those by
   hand when they are load-bearing. Transient 5xx: re-run before believing it.
